# Node.js boilerplate - Typescript + Jest

Replaces my previous boilerplate ([ts-node & mocha](https://github.com/andrezero/boilerplate-ts-nyc-mocha#kudos))

Uses:

- [typescript 4](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [jest 26.4](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)
- [eslint 7.8](https://eslint.org/) + [prettier 2](https://prettier.io/)

Bootstraps:

- [express 4.7](https://expressjs.com/) + [http-pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http)

## dev scripts

- `npm test` - test and coverage
- `npm run coverage` - html coverage report
- `npm run lint -- --fix` - fix linting problems
- `npm run dev` - watch, build and run (pretty logs)

## ci scripts

- `npm run ci` - lint, test and build

## production
